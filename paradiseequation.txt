Akash is a student in IIT Kanpur and has the infamous MTH102 this semester. The assignment requires you to help Akash solve this factorilal
equation and help get A* grade. 
Your task is to find all the possible triplets (a,b,c) in which the max(a,b,c)<=k . you must return your answer in a sorted order of (a).

               2^a + 2^b = c!

where 2^b denotes 2 to the power of b and c! denotes c factorial.
You have to answer t independent test cases.

INPUT:

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then t lines describing the test cases follow.

The i-th of these lines contains one integer k (1≤k≤10^5) — the goal of the i-th test case.

OUTPUT:

For each test case, print all the  integer triplets(a,b,c) satisfying the factorial paradise equation in which the max(a,b,c)<=k — in sorted order. IF no such solution exist print -1;


Example
