The trivial solution we can see is  0 0 2. 
One way to approach this is modular arithimetic.Taking %n on both sides. the answer should match on both sides of equation if there exists 
an solution in that limit;

taking mod7 (%7) on paradise equation
	2^a (%7) can either be 1 or 2 or 4 for any n.
if c>=7 c! will have a factor of 7 and hence it will be 0 on operation with %7 but any combination of 2^a + 2^b will not result in a factor of 7.

hence c<7;

now checking manually for c<7 we get the following triplets

0 0 2
1 2 3
2 1 3
3 4 4
4 3 4
