Akash is a student in IIT Kanpur and has the infamous MTH101 this semester. The assignment requires you to help Akash solve this TLE problem and help get A* grade. 
You will be given an array and two pairs (l,r)<=n which denotes the indices of the array . 

You will have to compute the the gcd(1 to L) and lcm(n to R) and return the sum of these two.

You have to answer t independent test cases and q queries.

INPUT:

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤10^5) — the number of test cases. Then t lines describing the test cases follow.

The i-th of these lines contains two integers n (1≤n≤10^5) and q(1≤q≤10^5) — the length of the array. Then the array is given in N integers.
 And q queries follow in q lines where ith line denotes ith query containing ith L and R. 

OUTPUT:

For each test case, print the output individually in q lines.
